            <p>TreBus is an app to help you navigate your bus schedules in the city of Tampere.</p>
            <p>The point is to add Hotspots: places you often visit, like your home, workplace, school...</p>
            <p>
                TreBus uses geolocation to locate you (when possible) and tells you how fast and how to get to
                those hotspots from your current location.
